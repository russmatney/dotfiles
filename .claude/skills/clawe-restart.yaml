  Restart the Clawe window management system services.

  Available services:
  - doctor-backend: Core backend service
  - doctor-frontend: Frontend UI components
  - doctor-topbar: Top bar widget
  - doctor-dashboard: Dashboard interface

  Steps:
  1. If specific service(s) mentioned, restart only those
  2. If no service specified, ask which ones to restart or offer to restart all
  3. Use systemd user services: `systemctl --user restart <service>`
  4. Check service status after restart
  5. Show relevant logs if there are issues: `journalctl --user -u <service> -n 20`
  6. Verify the services are running correctly

  Common issues to check:
  - Babashka (bb) availability
  - Working directory access: /home/russ/russmatney/clawe
  - DISPLAY environment variable for GUI components
  - Dependencies between services
