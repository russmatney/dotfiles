dotfiles
========

Zsh with oh-my-zsh, tmux, vim with plugins via vundle, and an install.rb script

##Installation

Clone into ~/dotfiles and run `ruby install.rb`.
This will setup symlinks for your files and install vim plugins.

##zshrc
##vimrc

I love me some vim!

I use vundle to handle plugins, and the install.rb will automagically pull + install any repos you add to the vundle file.

##tmux.conf

##TODO:

- Baby stepping blog post
- overview of each file/what it does/how it's used
- usage for the install.rb
